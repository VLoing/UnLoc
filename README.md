# UnLoc
This repository contains the test codes for the paper [Virtual Training for a Real Application: Accurate Object-Robot Relative Localization without Calibration](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~loingvi/unloc/).

## Data and Trained models
UnLoc dataset is composed of three sub-datasets ('lab', 'field', 'adv'). They can be downloaded [here](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~loingvi/unloc/UnLoc.tar.gz).
Trained models presented in the paper can be download [here](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~loingvi/unloc/unloc_trained_models.tar.gz).
CAD models of the ABB IRB120 robot are available on this [page](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/industrial-robots/irb-120/irb-120-cad).
